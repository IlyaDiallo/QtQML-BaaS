Directories

    doc/
        Contains documentation on the project in general (not yet actually)

    examples/
        Contains a set of example applications that utilize the module. (only one sample for now)

    plugin/
        Contains the QML module.

    tests/
        Contains a set of tests that are used for testing/debugging the implementation. (not yet actually)

Building

    To build the module, change to the "plugin" directory and command

        qmake && make && make install

    This compiles the module and installs it to plugin/install. After this you can use the
    module in your QML application by doing "import BaaS 1.0". Notice that you must
    have the plugin/install directory in your QML module import path. For further usage
    description see examples/ . FIXME : qmldir must be deployed manually

    For now, only Parse Server is supported as Backend services.
    see https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server for installation details

Documentation (WIP)

    To generate the documentation, change to the "doc" directory and command

        qdoc *.qdocconf

    This generates the documentation in HTML format in a directory called "html".
